# gmtk-2019

A game for GMTK Game Jam 2019.

The game is vanilla javascript and built with [pixi].

## How to play the game

Eventaully, I'm hoping to have it published online.

For now, clone or download the repository.

You'll need to serve the folder to get around browser security.

You can do this by running `python3 -m http.server` in the directory where the
game files are, then going to the IP:port combo it tells you (0.0.0.0:8000 by
default, I believe).
